        Although I'm unsure of where I want to be after completing my degree, I would like to try and work as one of the three roles listed below to gain a varied skill set.
        I find these three roles attractive as I would like to put effort into creating something with a real word effect to help and work towards improving an experience for others.
        I believe that these roles will equip with invaluable skills such as soft skills, effective communication and developing involved and dynamic experiences.

        <li>Badminton:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I play badminton weekly on Thursday evenings, Badminton is a racquet sport in which a <abbr title="shuttlecock">shuttle</abbr> is hit across a net. To score points in Badminton one must get the <abbr title="shuttlecock">shuttle</abbr> to hit the floor on the opposing side of the net. Badminton generally has 2 different game modes being doubles and singles. A match is usually best of 3 and each game is won when one side acquires 21 points.

        <li>Rocket League</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At this moment in time, my current favourite video game is rocket league this is due to its unique gameplay and in-game physics in which you pilot a car which can fly, with the aim of the game being to score more goals than your opponents. When queuing ranked I place around the rank of Champ 2 which puts me in the top 12% world wide in skill level. There are many different aspects to the game such as smaller sub communities which include things such as modding and freestyling. which work towards hitting cool shots and improving or changing the out of box experience.
